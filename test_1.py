This program is trying to determine which payment option is better (more money).
Option 1 is paying $100 per day for 10 days. Option 2 is $1 per day doubling each day for 10 days. There will
be 2 functions to calculate the pay rate. function1 will calculate the amount for the first option, while function 2
will calculate the amount for the 2nd option.

function1 will output 100 * 10 days.
function2 will loop 10 times, with each loop doubling and adding to the total.

If the amount is equal, we output to the user "Option 1 and Option 2 pays the same" 
If option1 is better, we output to the user "Option 1  is better"
If option2 is better, we output to the user "Option 2  is better"
